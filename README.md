# Random-User-API-Performance-Test

## About this project:
### In this project, I used Apache JMeter to create a script accessible through a public URL. The goal was to gradually increase the server load until we identified its breaking point or stress test limit. Our objective was to determine how many transactions per second (TPS) the server could handle effectively, and I aimed to test it with 120,000 users.

## Tools & Technology used:
- Apache JMeter

## Prerequisites
- JDK

## How to run this project:
jmeter -n -t yourfile.jmx -l yourfile-log.csv
